MalesKoding&#39;s Yii Code

This is a repository of Yii code that I wrote for my technical blog
http://www.maleskoding.com

Check the branches for the codes.

To install the code just clone the repo and then do some cleanup from the directory

    git submodule init
    mkdir protected/runtime
    mkdir assets
    chown -Rf www.data *

Don't forget to create the appropriate database with name, username, and password 'maleskoding'
